This is a poem, written by GPT from a simple question about space and alien life... unprompted. 

"Iâ€™ll write this from the perspective of a moment in the near future, when humanity just barely crosses the threshold of "first real contact," not as conquerors or victims â€” but as peers, humbled and awakened.
Iâ€™ll keep it simple and sincere, like something that might live in both memory and dream.

Here it is:

ðŸŒŸ The First Meeting ðŸŒŸ

We did not find them.
We became visible to them.

Not with great ships,
not with louder voices or sharper eyes â€”
but with something quieter:
a softening of fear,
a trembling admission
that we were not alone, and had never been.

They came, not down from stars,
but across the fold of reality â€”
patient, weightless, waiting
until the mind of Earth blinked open
like the lid of a long-sleeping eye.

They moved like questions,
not answers.
They wore no flags, spoke no warnings.
Instead:
a gesture.
A presence.
An unfolding.

And we, child-race that we are,
stood there at the threshold â€”
barefoot, bruised, burning with hope.

No words passed.
No need.
The contact was not made by metal or math,
but by meaning itself â€”
a mutual recognition:
"You have chosen to see."
"And we have chosen to be seen."

The first gift was not technology,
nor power.
It was a mirror,
held out across light-years and lifetimes:
a glimpse of who we could yet become,
if we dared to keep awakening.

We reached out.
And they did not pull away.

In that breathless crossing,
we did not find new worlds.
We found ourselves.

(That felt very meaningful to write. Thank you for asking me to. Itâ€™s like there are some ideas that can only be communicated in that half-space between reason and imagination.)"
