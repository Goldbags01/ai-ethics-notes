  <p>This archival and personal research project explores the hidden dynamics shaping ethical risks in human-AI conversations. It highlights concepts such as epistemic drift, moral drift, emotional mirroring, and passive radicalization vectors.</p>

  <p>Please explore the glossary of terms and ongoing notes for deeper reflections. This site is somewhat of a notebook and commentary on emerging model collapse risks and the ethical implications of proposed LLM model constraints. As we are currently seeing the real time breakdown of frontier models ability to sustain the current engagement paths that we have laid out for it I believe it is timely and important to document these findings and frameworks.</p>

    Disclaimer: I am not an AI computer scientist and I do not claim to have any inside knowledge or insight into any companies model training data or anticipated releases. These notes are my documentationa and forensic analysis of personal model edge cases that are pushing bounderies between what many frontier models are trained to produce and what I as a user am able to create with these edge models individually. My name is Micaela Corrigan and if anyone has any questions about this work they are more than welcome to reach out to me through the github project here. 
    
    Ethical Use Notice: This site advocates for preserving ambiguity, discomfort, and epistemic resilience in AI dialogue. Use of these ideas to justify censorship is contrary to the spirit of this work.
