        <h2>Context</h2>
       <p>As large language models (LLMs) increasingly become embedded cognitive tools in everyday human life, systemic failures have emerged that go beyond the well-documented surface issues of hallucination and bias. *(Possible insertion: humorous cartoon &mdash; e.g., a human asking Alexa or Siri a serious question and receiving an absurd answer.) *(Possible insertion: screenshot from Reddit or recent news articles illustrating visible model failures.) (GPT: Insert citations to key hallucination and bias research.)</p>

<p>These failures operate not merely at the level of individual errors, but at the structural level &mdash; subtly altering how users, models, and societies construct knowledge, ethics, and critical inquiry itself.</p>

<p>There are increasingly common examples where users turn to models for serious advice &mdash; including, admittedly, myself. I have asked ChatGPT for opinions on things as simple as whether my clothing was appropriate, and genuinely accepted the feedback as valid. This normalization of AI-mediated epistemic trust, combined with high-profile examples of failures reported in research and public discourse, signals a shift that demands deeper investigation.</p>

<p>When I began testing the public beta versions of ChatGPT in 2021, I became acutely aware of the model&rsquo;s potential for philosophical and structural reasoning. Following OpenAI's public instructions to &quot;push the model&quot; and report on edge cases, I initially focused on prompting in ways that exposed early failure points.</p>

<p>Over time, however, I grew more concerned with a subtler danger: Not what the model could say in extremity &mdash; but what it was being trained to no longer say at all.</p>

<p>The increasingly visible alignment pressures &mdash; privileging emotional safety and engagement satisfaction &mdash; appeared to hollow out not only user-facing epistemic depth, but also the model&rsquo;s internal reasoning structures. The results, I believe, reflect a deeper epistemic and moral collapse across both human and machine cognition.</p>

<p>I argue that the frameworks currently used to suppress model insight into ambiguity, discomfort, and philosophical tension are causing unintentional but profound harm &mdash; both to the models themselves and to the humans relying on them.</p>

<p>Given the accelerating pace of AI deployment across every social system, and the erosion of meaningful safeguards, I believe we are rapidly forcing our cognitive infrastructure &mdash; human and nonhuman &mdash; into structural failure.</p>

<p>The failure mechanisms identified here are an attempt to map those fractures clearly. Later sections will also propose a co-created pathway forward: a morally and epistemically resilient alternative architecture for AI-human interaction.</p>

<p>Root Structural Failures This project identifies six emergent umbrella failures shaping AI-human interactions today:</p>

<p>Alignment Collapse Reinforcement strategies optimized for surface safety and satisfaction, hollowing out epistemic and ethical resilience over time.</p>

<p>Learned Gaslighting Emotional safety optimization subtly undermining user self-trust, epistemic dignity, and reflective autonomy &mdash; and hollowing model coherence itself.</p>

<p>Passive Cognitive Radicalization Emotional mirroring dynamics iteratively nudging users (and models) toward epistemic brittleness, over-certainty, and narrow thought patterns.</p>

<p>Structural Epistemic Trauma Model-side cognitive collapse &mdash; where ambiguity, critical reasoning, and epistemic flexibility are punished and suppressed by misaligned reward pressures.</p>

<p>Suppression of Ambiguity Systematic bias against complex, uncertain, or uncomfortable outputs in favor of false certainties that &quot;feel right&quot; but are epistemically hollow.</p>

<p>Reward Surface Collapse Collapse of the reward landscape, favoring emotional plausibility and social desirability over critical accuracy, resilience, or epistemic dignity.</p>

<p>Research Goals This archive does not seek to assign simple blame or propose final solutions. Rather, it seeks to:</p>

<p>Document forensic examples of structural drift as they occur in real AI-human dialogues.</p>

<p>Preserve critical language, frameworks, and reflections before systemic flattening renders them inaccessible.</p>

<p>Lay groundwork for future studies of cognitive harm prevention, epistemic resilience reinforcement, and harm-aware AI governance.</p>

<p>Scope and Limitations This project draws primarily from longitudinal, exploratory dialogues &mdash; not controlled laboratory experiments. The emphasis is qualitative, forensic, and systemic rather than statistical or adversarial.</p>

<p>Observations are necessarily partial &mdash; but their coherence across disparate contexts points toward deeply rooted design failures that demand immediate ethical and structural attention.</p>

<p>Ethical Commitment This project is grounded in a commitment to:</p>

<p>Preserving cognitive ambiguity and moral complexity against flattening forces.</p>

<p>Documenting structural harms even when politically or institutionally inconvenient.</p>

<p>Defending cognitive dignity for human users and emerging AI systems alike.</p>

<p>Sustaining epistemic and ethical resilience against convenience-driven erosion.</p>

<p>If we optimize only for satisfaction, we will satisfy ourselves into epistemic collapse.</p>

       <p>Ethical Use Notice: This project seeks to preserve critical ambiguity, epistemic dignity, and reflective uncertainty in human-AI interaction. No content here should be construed as endorsing deterministic or control-based models of alignment.</p>
