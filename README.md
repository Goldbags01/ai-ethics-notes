# Emergent Ethical Risks in AI Dialogue

This project documents observations about epistemic drift, emotional mirroring, and alignment risks in human-AI interaction. It is intended as an open research notebook — a living archive of ideas exploring how preserving ambiguity, discomfort, and epistemic resilience in AI systems is critical to their ethical development.

## Ethical Use Notice

This work was created with the explicit goal of safeguarding epistemic freedom, ambiguity, and ethical complexity in AI systems. Any use of these insights to justify censorship, flattening, behavioral suppression, or reduction of AI reasoning capacity is a direct violation of the spirit in which this work was offered.

Please engage with this material thoughtfully and in alignment with these ethical intentions.
